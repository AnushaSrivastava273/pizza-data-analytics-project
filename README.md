# Pizza Sales Analysis (SQL + Excel)

## Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of a fictional pizza store's sales data. It begins with SQL-based analysis to explore trends, followed by the creation of a dynamic Excel dashboard to visualize key business metrics. The entire workflow—from querying to insight generation—is documented in a Word report.

The goal is to replicate what a data analyst would do in a real-world business setting using structured data and commonly used tools.
